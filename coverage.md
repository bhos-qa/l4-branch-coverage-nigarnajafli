## Branch coverage
Branch coverage is a metric that indicates whether all branches in a codebase are exercised by tests. A "branch" is one of the possible execution paths the code can take after a decision statement—e.g., an if statement—gets evaluated.

## Statement coverage
Statement coverage is a white box testing technique in which all the executable statements in the source code are executed at least once. It is used for calculation of the number of statements in source code which have been executed.

## Predicate coverage
Condition coverage is also known as Predicate Coverage in which each one of the Boolean expression have been evaluated to both TRUE and FALSE.
